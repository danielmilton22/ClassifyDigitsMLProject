# ClassifyDigitsMLProject

The MNIST data set is a data set that contains 60,000 small squared pixel grayscale images of
handwritten digits between 0 and 9

The goal of this project was to be able to use some
unsupervised learning techniques from the first half of the class in order to identify these digits. From
class, we learned that unsupervised machine learning consists of using data with no labels to create a
class as an output. For the project we use three different algorithms in attempts to classify the digit
images: Single Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution, Kmeans Clustering, and a Mixture of Multivariate
Bernoulli Models
